The idea is to improve pi planning efforts and capacity management.

There is no real need behind, but it is used to push my experience and learning on a development objective..

Putting it in github, is also to improve my learning curve after the training on github.

Most of my trainings comes from skilleos and udemy..

Note: You need to put on PYTHONPATH the directory py_tools and python_files. or merge all together
